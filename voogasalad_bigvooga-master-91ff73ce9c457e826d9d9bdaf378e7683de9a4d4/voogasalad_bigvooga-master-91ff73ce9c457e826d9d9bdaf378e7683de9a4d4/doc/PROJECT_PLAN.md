AUTHORING:
The authoring team is Dara Buggay, ryan Chung, Sam Slack, and Owen Smith. We split roles on the authoring environment into two components: pure front end and UI, which is Dara and Ryan, and integration between authoring and backend, which is Sam and Owen. 
Ryan and Dara plan on making all of the components of the UI, and having them designed in such a way that they are flexible according to the needs of the backend. They will have the option to apply new features, properties, and events/actions to specific options or to overall classes using drop down menus and checkboxes. They will creates these windows that give information about the properties of objects. 
Sam and Owen will be responsible for constantly communicating with the engine to obtain updates on objects and object features. They will be responsible for creating the methods in the external front end and back end APIs, and passing the information shared via these methods through the controller. Example methods that will be required to be implemented are described in the API document such as  public SpriteParameter addNewParameter(String name, String type). Of course, they will break up these APIs into specific components, like for updating object or map components. They will also be responsible for data serialization and managing resource files like images and properties files for labels of different UI and sprite object components. They will be utilizing XML files and customized data serialized classes for these purposes.

PLAYER:

The player team is David Tran and Samarth Desai. They will both be responsible for keeping the front-end game components updated and accurate with respect to the game engine. They will also be responsible for updating the interface in the welcome screen whenever an icon is clicked. Since the View communicates with the controller which communicates with the EngineController, they will make sure that communication throughout the MVC is functional. Key and mouse inputs are the primary source of user input that needs to be handled. In addition, buttons and other front-end features may need to be created by the View after communicating with the game engine.
