Notes from users testing out our authoring environment:
- unable to always delete sprites from the grid
- size of inventory window cuts off tab
- row/col size of sprite and grid only works using up/down errors- gets buggy when user tries to type in a number
- size display doesn't work (zig zags) sometimes
- settings don't do anything
- some side tabs don't allow you to change back to main auth env
- sprite selection error

Overall this exercise was very useful in seeing how an outsider interacts with our environment. We were able to catch bugs for things that were not working 
properly and also began to think in what ways we could alter our environment so that it was more user friendly and easy to understand.
