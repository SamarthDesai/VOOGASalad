IntroHeading = Welcome to VOOGA.
IntroBody = VOOGA is an expansive game authoring environment that allows you to create, save, and then play any game. \
			Let us go over the best practices when using it.
AuthoringHeading = Authoring Games
AuthoringBody = Authoring is the primary function of VOOGA. The authoring environment can be accessed by selecting "Create" in the main menu. \
				From there, you can choose to either create a new project or continue editing an existing project. If you choose to start a new game, \
				the authoring environment will open with a clean slate for you to work with, giving you only the default game objects. \
				Loading an existing game will open all the maps, sprites, dialogues, etc. that had been created in the project. \n\
				Map Editor: In the Map Editor, we attempt to offer great flexibility in what you can create. \
				To get started with creating your game, you can add sprites to the map by either dragging them over from the Sprites tab \
				or by clicking on cells in the grid and clicking on a sprite to populate the cells with that sprite. \
				The grid has a number of useful features in helping you create your game: you can modify the size of your map using the grid size selector, \
				and you can specify what layers each sprite will go on using the adjacent layer selector. To modify information about individual sprites, \
				simply click on a sprite either in the Sprites tab or on the grid, and a display panel will appear in the top left of the screen. \
				In this panel, you can view the essential state-definers of the sprite, including its parameters, conditions, actions, inventory, and animation sequence. \
				You can modify these properties, and define how your game and all the objects and characters within it will behave. \
				**Talk about linking dialogues and cutscenes, etc.** \
				\n\
				Sprite Creator: In the Sprite Creator, we allow you to create the different sprites you can use in your game. \
				To create a sprite, you can start by either loading a new image from your machine, or by selecting an existing sprite. \
				If you load a new image for your sprite, you will have to define its properties by scratch. \
				However, if you use an existing sprite for your new sprite template, you can access that sprite's existing properties and modify them to your desire.
				
PlayerHeading = Playing Created Games
PlayerBody = Once you finish building and subsequently saving your game, you can go ahead and play it! \
			To play the game that was created, simply select 'Play' in the main menu, and choose which game to play. \
			If you previously made progress that you saved in the selected game, you have the option to continue from where you left off. \
			Otherwise, there is the option to start the game from the beginning, which is "New Game."
FAQHeading = FAQ
FAQBody = Q: Can I create games other than RPGs? \n\
		A: Fortunately, VOOGA was built with a great deal of flexibility. \
		Although VOOGA is primarily intended for RPGs, we currently support platformer games, \
		and our functionality extends itself quite well to other genres such as puzzle games. \n\
		Q: How long did it take to create VOOGA? \n\
		A: Too long :)
